# CT Runner

The easiest way to track your Run169 Towns progress. This project was inspired by [https://run169.com](https://run169.com). A group that has a shared goal: run a race in every town in Connecticut. While we love the group and are part of it, we felt like submitting towns could be more simple, less error-prone and streamlined. Thus, we created [CT Runner](https://ctrunner.org).
